# DU-(Developer-Utility)-like-STL
Actually, during my college project, I researched STL, a big concept in C++ that how STL works, i.e. at the time of Competitive Coding or handling any Large project in C++ how is it providing all those facilities to the users?. Finally, I did all those concepts but still, I could not make iterator in it and one more thing in STL: list<int>l1{49,4860,10,20};  //curly braces-initialization
I can't do this in my created project, but I have done all the varieties of data structures in it and made their no. of functions, you can go through this project mine and give me feedback if you use it How did you feel, according to your opinion, please advise me. Thank you
